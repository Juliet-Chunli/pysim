PyNSim Architecture
=====================

Design
------

PyNSim consists of three main components: A Simulator, Engine and the network components,
namely Network, Node, Link and Institution.

Network
^^^^^^^
A network contains nodes, links and institusions.

Node
^^^^
A node represents a point in the network, normally representing some physical
building or area of land within the network.

Link
^^^^
At their most simplest, links simply connect nodes, but links can be more
complex, with different types of links representing different types of connections,
such as rivers, pipes, streams etc. Links can have their own attribute such as
flow rate.

Institution
^^^^^^^^^^^
An institution contains a subset of the nodes and links within a network. An
institution typically represents a governing body, for example: 'The department
of water' or 'The department of agriculture'. There can be multiple institutions
within a network and different institutions can contain the same nodes & links.

Engine
^^^^^^
In PyNSim, **an engine is a piece of software which performs some action on 
a resource**. An engine reads values from the nodes and links within an institution,
performs some calculation and then performs some type of save function, which
usually sets values back on these nodes and links. These values may then be used
in a subsequent engine run.

A n engine must run on one resource, so if a calculation is to be performed on multiple
nodes and links, they must be contained within an institution.

Simulator
^^^^^^^^^
The simulator class is what gets run by a user. It is a container for the
appropriate models and resources. In a simulator, timesteps are defined
and the simulation is run. A simulation can be stopped or paused while
it is running, but will only stop at the end of the currently running
time step.

Multiple models can be specified for use in a model, and must be run
in a specific order. This order is defined when setting up the simulation.

At each time step in the simulator, all the models are run in order.

The simulator applies an engine, or a number of engines, to a network over a number of specified
time steps.

A simulation if PyNSim has the following workflow:

1. A simulator is created (:ref:`creating_a_simulator`).
2. A network is created and added to the simulatori (:ref:`defining_the_network`).
3. An engine or number or engines are created (:ref:`defining_the_engines`).
4. The engines are added to the simulator.
5. The timesteps of the simulator are defined.
6. The simulator **start()** function is called.
7. The simulator iterates over all its timesteps. In each timestep:

 A. The **setup()** function of each Institution is called
 B. The **setup()** function of each Node is called
 C. The **setup()** function of each Link is called
 D. The **run()** function of each Engine is called.

8. The simulation ends.

.. _setup_functions:

Setup Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each node, link, network and institution in a pynsim model must implement a 'def setup(self, timestep)' function.
This function is run at the start of each timestep **before** the engines are run.
Setup functions are normally used to assign data to a resource which will be used by engines
in that time step. For example, a node might say ''My demand for this timestep is: 123''. The
number 123 would normally be found in a pre-defined list or dictionary, which was defined
when creating the node.

.. _class_structure:

Class Structure
---------------
.. figure:: uml.png
    :alt: This is a class diagram of PyNSim with some example subclasses displayed at the bottom.

This UML diagram of PyNSim shows the different components with different colours.
The blue box is the Simulator class. This class has exactly one Network and
can have multiple Models. All resources classes are shown in green. As shown,
Network, Node, Link and Institution all inherit from Resource.

The model class, in pink, has a target, which must be a resource.


The large green box represents the 'core' elements of PyNSim. These
elements are meant to be extended for use in specific simulation types.
This extention can be seen in the light beige box, in which two models types
are defined alongside two node types, two institution types and a link type.
We call this set of extentions a 'Generic Water Model'. 

When this set of classes is applied to a specific problem, we call it an 
Model

.. _defining_custom_types:

Defining Custom Types
---------------------
The basic components of PyNSim can be extended for use in a specific application.
For example, if a simulation of supply and demand is being run, two types of Node
might be 'Surface Reservoir' (supply) and 'Farm' (demand). Each of these
nodes will have its own attributes, for example 'storage' in the case of the
reservoir and 'demand' in the case of the Farm. Links can be extented in much
the same way; for example a 'River' is a link, which might have 'maximum flow'
and 'minimum' flow parameters.

Similarly, custom institutions can be defined, for example: 'The ministry of water'
which controls all the nodes and therefore all the nodes in the network are contained
within it and 'Irrigation Decision Maker', which only has control over the demand
nodes. A model run on each of these insitutions will make decisions (set values)
about their own nodes and links.

For an example on how custom types are defined, see here TODO: put in link here.

.. _defining_custom_engines

Defining Custom Engines
-----------------------
The base engine class must be extended to apply a new type of engine to a simulator.
Every engine has a 'run' function, which must implement the actual engine
run. This may involve writing python code to perform a calculation, but
most likely it will involve accessing an external modelling system such
as GAMS. The external model will be run, the results extracted and the 
resource (on which every model must run) updated.

.. _example:

Example
-------

This example shows how a water department might operate. A water department in our
example is an instution in charge of all the nodes in the system. Using an allocation
table, the water department assigns its reservoir a release based on the amount of water in the network at a given time step.

First, import a basic institution from pynsim::

 from pynsim import Institution

Next create the water department class::

 class WaterDepartment(Institution):
     name = "Government department in charge of water"

The `_properties` parameter of an institution **must** be defined. This defines
what constitutes a water department::

     _properties = dict(
         flow_requirements=[],
         allocation       = 1000
     )

The water department release curve is an internal parameter to this institution
and simply maps a reservoir release to an incoming water quantity::

     #Based on rainfall in mm, how much will the surface reservoir get?
     _release_curve = (
         (0 , 100),
         (10, 150),
         (20, 250),
         (30, 500),
         (40, 750),
         (50, 1000),
         (60, 1250),
         (70, 1500),
         (80, 1750),
         (90, 2000),
         (100, 2500),
     )

The next step is the most important part of a pynsim class. It is the setup
function. This is the place where at each timestep a component makes decisions about
what to do. In this case, it finds the incoming water supply and sets the release
from the reservoir::

     def setup(self, timestamp):
         incoming_water = self.network.incoming_water_qty[timestamp]
       
         reservoir = self.getnodes("SurfaceReservoir")[0]

         for alloc in self._release_curve:
             if alloc[0] <= incoming_water:
                 continue
             else:
                 reservoir.release = alloc[1]
                 break

To simplify, this function finds a node of a particular type in a network or
institution::

     def getnodes(self, component_type):
         
         nodes = []
         for n in self.nodes:
             if n.component_type == component_type:
                 nodes.append(n)
         return nodes

.. _imports:

Imports
^^^^^^^

First, the appropriate node, link and institution types must be imported
from the desired package. In this example, we use the 'jordanproject' package::

 from components import SurfaceReservoir, RiverSection, CitrusFarm, VegetableFarm
 from components import WaterDepartment , IrrigationDecisionMaker

Next, we import the models we want to use::

 from engines import DeficitAllocation

Finally, import the basic PyNSim stuff, like the simulator and a generic link
We are assuming that for this example, there is no need to create a special type
of link, so we use the basic one provided by pynsim::

 from pynsim import Simulator, Network

.. _creating_a_simulator:

Creating the simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simulator file can be found `here </home/stephen/git/PyNSim/examples/stanford_demo/wet_year_simulation.py>`_

First, create a new simulator::

 s = Simulator()

Then define the timesteps the simulator will use::

 s.set_timesteps(["2014-01-01", "2014-01-02", "2014-01-03"])

.. _defining_the_network:

Defining the network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next, define the network structure by creating a new network, then creating
the nodes and links::

 n = JordanRiverNetwork(name="Example Jordan river network")
 n.incoming_water_qty = {"2014-01-01" : 10,
                         "2014-02-01" : 22,
                         "2014-03-01" : 35,
                         "2014-04-01" : 22,
                         "2014-05-01" : 10}

 irr1 = CitrusFarm(x=1,   y=2,   name="I1")
 irr2 = CitrusFarm(x=10,  y=20,  name="I2")
 irr3 = VegetableFarm(x=100, y=200, name="I3")

 n.add_nodes(sr1, irr1, irr2, irr3)


 #Create some links
 n.add_link(RiverSection(start_node=sr1, end_node=irr1))
 n.add_link(RiverSection(start_node=sr1, end_node=irr2))
 n.add_link(RiverSection(start_node=sr1, end_node=irr3))

Next create the institutions in the network::

 #The ministry of water has control over all the nodes
 mow = WaterDepartment("Jordan Ministry of Water")
 mow.add_nodes(sr1, irr1, irr2, irr3)
 
 #The jordan valley authority has only control over the irrigation nodes
 jva = IrrigationDecisionMaker("Jordan Valley Authority")
 jva.add_nodes(irr1, irr2, irr3)

 n.add_institutions(mow, jva)

Now that the network is completely defined, add the network to the scenario::
 s.network = n

.. _defining_the_engines:

Defining the simulators' engines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The next step is to introduce all the engines this simulation will use. Remember
we these have been included above, so adding them to the simulator is a simple
matter of creating one of each like so, passing in the institution to which the 
model will be applied::

 allocator = DeficitAllocation(n)

When adding the models to the simulator, it might be necessary to specify an order,
so that one model is run before another. Do do this, we call the 'add_model'
function with a paramater called 'depends_on'. A model which depends on other models
can only be run when each of its dependent models are run first::

 # flow routing doesn't depend on any other models
 s.add_model(allocator) 

Finally, start the simulation::

 s.start()

To print out the results of the defecit allocation, we look into each irrigation
node and find out its deficit::

 total_deficit = 0
 for n in n.nodes:
     if n.component_type == 'irrigation':
         print "%s deficit = %s"%(n.name, n.deficit)
         total_deficit += n.deficit

 print "Total deficit: %s"%(total_deficit)
